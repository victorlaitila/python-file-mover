# Move Latest Downloaded File(s)

This script moves the latest downloaded file(s) from the "Downloads" folder to a target folder (or subfolder) located on the Desktop. You can specify the number of files to move, and the script will confirm the action if more than 5 files are to be moved.

## Usage:

1. Navigate to the root of the project.
2. Run the script using the following command:

python move.py <target_folder> [num_files]

- `<target_folder>`: The name of the folder on your Desktop where the files will be moved. 
- `[num_files]`: (Optional) The number of files you want to move. If omitted, only the latest file will be moved.
